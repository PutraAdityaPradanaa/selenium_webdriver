Selenium WebDriver with java

In order to write scripts using the Selenium WebDriver Java client, we'll need the following:

The Java programming language. we'll use version 10 or higher

We're also going to use the Intelligent Editor to write our code.

Selenium WebDriver can be executed against all of the major browsers. So we need the Selenium chromedriver executable

#Installing Java
We're on Oracle's website and this is where we can download Java.
We see here that there are multiple versions there is Java 12, as well as Java 11, and Java 8. We need Java 10 or greater
If you already have 10 or greater, then you're fine. You don't need to download this again.
If you don't have any of those, then let's go ahead and get you set up.
Let's use version 12.

#Installing IntelliJ
The next thing we're going to do is to install IntelliJ, which again will be the editor that we write our code in.

There are multiple operating systems supported Windows, Mac and Linux, so choose the operating system of your choice.

And then there are also 2 options here: one that says Ultimate and one for Community.

The Ultimate is for web and enterprise development. There is a free trial but then you need to purchase it.

Or you can use the Community edition, which is what I use. This one is free and open source.

You just click “DOWNLOAD”.

Don't worry about the form that comes up, it's already downloading.

Once it's finished downloading, just double click on that file. Again, this will be different if on Windows, but you'll still have an executable that you can use, and it'll walk you through.

For Mac, all we need to do is to drag this over and follow any prompts.

Again, we're just using default options, so nothing special there.


#Installing Chrome Browser
Next we're going to install the Chrome browser.


#Installing Chrome Driver
Finally, we want to download chromedriver.

This is the WebDriver for Chrome, which is the browser that we'll be using.

It has to match with whatever version of Chrome that you're actually using.

So, go ahead and check your version of Chrome. You can click on the hamburger menu in the top right corner and then on “Help” > “About Google Chrome”. There we can see what version of Chrome than you're on.

I'm on version 75 so I'm going to need to get the chromedriver that corresponds to this version.
